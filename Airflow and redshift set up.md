### To replace the placeholders your-s3-bucket and your-redshift-iam-role with the appropriate values, you need to follow these steps:

* Replace your-s3-bucket with the name of the S3 bucket where your data files are located. For example, if your bucket name is my-data-bucket, update the S3 paths in the code as follows:

* Replace 's3://your-s3-bucket/orders_raw_stage_{0}' with 's3://my-data-bucket/orders_raw_stage_{0}'.
* Replace 's3://your-s3-bucket/customer_raw_stage_{0}' with 's3://my-data-bucket/customer_raw_stage_{0}'.
* Replace your-redshift-iam-role with the IAM role that has the necessary permissions to access your Redshift cluster. This IAM role should have the necessary S3 read access and Redshift write access. Replace 'your-redshift-

### IAM-role' in the code with the actual IAM role name or ARN.

### Configure the Redshift connection (REDSHIFT_CONN_ID) in your Airflow connections. Follow these steps:

* Go to your Airflow UI.
* Click on the "Admin" tab in the top navigation menu.
* Click on "Connections" from the dropdown menu.
* Click on the "Create" button to create a new connection.
* Fill in the connection details for your Redshift cluster, such as Conn Id, Conn Type, Host, Schema, Login, Password, and Port.
* Save the connection.

#### Once you have completed these steps, your code will be updated with the correct S3 bucket paths and Redshift IAM role. The Redshift connection (REDSHIFT_CONN_ID) can be referenced in your code to establish the connection to your Redshift cluster during execution.
